# INTRODUCTION

# WHAT IS IT:
The Social Network Graph is a simple Java console application that uses a graph data structure to model a social network. In this application, users are vertices, and friendships are undirected edges. It demonstrates how graphs can represent relationships, add friends, suggest connections, and display networks.
# What It Can Do:
Add Users: Add users to the network. Add Friendships: Create friendships between users as undirected edges.Print the Network: Display the social network, showing each user and their friends.View Friends of a User: See the list of friends for any specific user.Suggest Friends: Suggest new friends based on mutual connections.
# WHY THIS APP:
I created this application to show how graphs can represent relationships in a social network. Itâ€™s a simple tool to visualize how people are connected and interact with each other. I wanted to make something easy to understand while highlighting how useful graphs can be in real-world scenarios.
# HOW IT CONTRIBUTES:
This application helps me understand graph theory and improve my Java skills while solving real-world problems. It also shows how simple concepts can lead to better recommendation systems and social network features that enhance user connections.
